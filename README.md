# note to self:
## set it up so I can use "catkin build", not "catkin_make"! (what's the difference, anyway??)
work with all sensitive data within the ignored_files/ directory! (because it is gitignored)

I can open the 3D meshes, but... It's a mesh so I can't do assembly using these as parts (I can approximate it though)

So, considering I can't put the meshes online, it may be better to just make rough 3D models myself...
